# React Native Food Delivery App

This project includes a React Native application where users can place food orders from restaurants and track their delivery in real-time. The mobile app allows users to explore a range of restaurants, view menus from their selected restaurant, customize their orders, and utilize real-time location tracking on a map to monitor deliveries.

## Features

**`Home Screen:`** Users are directed to a home screen where they can explore restaurants and place orders from their preferred restaurant. The home screen includes elements such as restaurant cards and a search bar.

**`Restaurant Pages:`** Each restaurant has its own page where users can view the restaurant's name, menu items, location, and other details. Additionally, users can add or remove items from the restaurant's menu.

**`Order Tracking:`** Users can track the status of their placed orders, including preparation, delivery process, and completion status. Order tracking is displayed in real-time on a map.

**`Map View:`** Users can track the delivery of their orders on a map. The map displays the user's location, the restaurant's location, and the delivery driver's location. Estimated time of arrival and the delivery driver's travel route are also shown on the map.
